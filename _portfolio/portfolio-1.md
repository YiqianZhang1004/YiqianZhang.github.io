__[Open Street Map Data of Russia-Ukraine Conflict](https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/r-sowers/ukraine-data)__ <br>
This research project aims to investigate how the Russia-Ukraine conflict is manifested in the Open Street Map (OSM). The project focuses on the data and visualization of changes to OSM concerning various engagements during the conflict. <br>

Teams from different semesters, under the direction of [Professor Sowers](https://publish.illinois.edu/r-sowers/), have contributed to this project. The project has a comprehensive set of tools and examples for analyzing the OSM data, visualizing geographical changes, generating word clouds, and more.<br>

Data related to various conflicts during the war, along with the visualizations created by the team, are stored in the __'Engagements'__ folder. Each engagement is represented by a set of visualizations, including heatmaps, wordclouds, and combination of both.<br>

The Python file __osm_analysis.py__ includes functions to visualize and analyze the OSM data, with an accompanying Jupyter notebook showing examples of these functions.<br>

The __'Tools and Examples'__ section provides several Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different types of analyses and visualizations on the OSM data. This includes mapping, visualizing specific cities or regions, generating word clouds for any city, and more.<br>

The project also includes an __API.md__ document, explaining how to interact with the OpenStreetMap API. Another notebook __changeset_element_explorer.ipynb__ helps understand each variable in the OSM 'element' and __'changeset'__, providing ways to link changeset ids with element ids and vice versa.<br>

Finally, the __'References'__ section provides links to external resources related to the Ukraine conflict, including a Wikipedia list of military engagements and conflict updates from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and Critical Threats Project (CTP).<br>
