I am a dedicated third-year Applied Mathematics and Statistics student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My fascination with data began early on, leading me to delve deeply into data analysis and science. This passion extends beyond mere numbers; I'm captivated by the narratives they craft and the insights they reveal. UIUC has sharpened my skills, empowering me to dissect complex datasets and derive valuable insights. I'm eager to apply this expertise, simplifying complicated data patterns into actionable knowledge. I thrive on challenges, always seeking opportunities that push my analytical boundaries and foster growth.
