Hi, everone! my name is Yiqian Zhang. I am currently a student in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My major is mathematics and statistics. I am very interested in data manipulation and geometry. At the same time, when I am in class, I am very good at integrating and processing key knowledge, so as to efficiently complete notes and study tasks. Since high school, my notes have been recognized by many teachers. I am an enthusiastic, motivated, hardworking, and rigorous person with a great passion for data analysis and data science. I am eager to be challenged in order to grow and further improve my analysis skill. My greatest passion in life is using my skills to make complex data simple.
