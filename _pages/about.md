Hi, everone! my name is Yiqian Zhang. I am currently a student in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My major is mathematics and statistics. I am very interested in data manipulation and geometry. At the same time, when I am in class, I am very good at integrating and processing key knowledge, so as to efficiently complete notes and study tasks. Since high school, my notes have been recognized by many teachers. I am very interested in self-study. Recently I am learning SQL. In my free time, I like to read some books and do some outdoor activities such as hiking.
